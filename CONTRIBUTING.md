## Checklist Contribution

All checklists on [Checklist](https://checklist.atolye15.com) is populating by the Markdown files that in [checklists](https://github.com/atolye15/checklist/blob/master/checklists) directory on this repository. If you want to add a new checklist you need to create a new markdown file on the directory, or if you want to update an existing one, you can edit the corresponding file and create a PR.

Since we use Markdown files for checklists, you can read Markdown notation from [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/) in case you're not familiar with it. We also use [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to provide some meta data to checklists. Here are the required Front Matter data for a valid Checklist.

We also have some tag using rules;

Tags are one of the main filtering elements that makes navigation easier and help us to keep everything in order.

As with anything else we have some rules for creating a tag;

* Tags should be self-explanotory and definitive.
* Tags should consist of one word only. If it really needs to have two or more words then please use a dash(-) to divide the words.
* Tags are related but different to the categories so they should not have the same name as it's categories.

Please provide all of the steps when you face the bug. It needs to include the current account information that you're having the issue with. Do not trust assignee to know everything. Never ever forget to provide all the essential steps.
